## About Pump Elf Ranch

Pump Elf Ranch is the first Web3 idle ranch game that stays at the bottom of your screen, accompanying you through work and study. With a meme-inspired theme, it offers a unique AI-driven social entertainment experience. You can purchase and nurture small animals, collect the gold coins they drop upon maturing, and earn profits to expand your ranch.

While you focus on self-improvement or leisure, these animals grow alongside you. Pump Elf Ranch seamlessly integrates engaging interactions with the powerful features of blockchain technology. As a revolutionary game with innovative interaction mechanisms, it uses AI to consolidate critical Web3 information and helps users discover new treasures more effortlessly. This transforms the way users interact with decentralized technology.
